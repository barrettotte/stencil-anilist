# anilist-stencil

Stencil.js component to display a public Anilist user.

Not a very good project, but I just wanted to play around with Stencil.js.
I kind of want to use this on my portfolio site so I'll probably come back later
and polish up the styling.

## Usage

```html
<anilist-user username="barrettotte"></anilist-user>
```
